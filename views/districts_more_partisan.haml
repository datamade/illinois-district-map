    %h2 Districts made more partisan

    %p
      [For an image, I’m seeing a map of the current 77th and 78th districts, with a pinpoint showing where Saviano, Camille Lilly, and Kathleen Willis live; Lilly and Willis could have blue pins and the Republican Saviano could have a red one.]

    %h4 Background
    %p
      Angelo "Skip" Saviano was first elected to the legislature in 1992 and had assumed a leadership position in the Republican caucus, chairing the House Republican Organization PAC.

      His district’s population had nearly kept pace with statewide growth, meaning that there were not population pressures to expand much. Despite his role in the caucus PAC, Saviano had a reputation for being able to work with Democrats. Indeed, he was one of a very few Republicans appointed by Speaker Madigan to chair a committee, leading the House Committee on Registration & Regulation for a time.

      Nonetheless, the new map put Saviano’s home into a new district that was both overwhelmingly Democratic and occupied by an incumbent Democratic legislator. Faced with a nearly impossible run in his home district, Saviano decided to jump into an open district just to his north. That was a toss-up on paper, but on Election Day resulted in a victory for his Democratic opponent by five percentage points.
